U.S. mortgage refis surge as rates fall to historically low levels,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage refinancings are surging as historically low 30-year fixed mortgage rates attract borrowers, Bespoke Investment Group said on Wednesday.  Mortgage rates fell below 3% last week and have continued lower, with the potential fall as low as 2%, Bespoke said in a note to clients.  “The implication is that the cost of home ownership is plunging and likely to fall further over coming months, fueling substantial activity in the housing market as the economy rebounds,” the note said.  U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell below 3% for the first time in records going back nearly 50 years last week, according to data released by Freddie Mac on Thursday.  The sharp decline in mortgage rates comes as investors rush into safe-haven assets, such as U.S. Treasuries, which have been trading near all-time lows, while the Federal Reserve has signaled it will keep rates low in response to the coronavirus pandemic by purchasing Treasuries and other bonds.  Mortgage rates are likely to fall to 2.75% before they bottom, said Douglas Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in an interview.  “If you’re a salaried person that’s pretty confident of your job, it’s a pretty good time to buy a house,” he said.  “If you are a pristine credit I’m sure you will be able to get a rate below 2.75%,” he added.  The experience for mortgage bond holders has been “brutal,” as large amounts of principle on higher-yielding mortgages are being paid back ahead of schedule due to refinancing, causing the duration of cash flows in mortgage bonds with higher coupons to decline rapidly, Bespoke said.

"Breakingviews - Corona Capital: Thanksgiving shopping, Airlines","NEW YORK/DALLAS/SAN FRANCISCO/LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights.  - Walmart’s Thanksgiving  - Southwest vs. everyone else  NOT A TURKEY. Walmart is closing its doors on Thanksgiving, the first time the $375 billion retailer is doing so in 30 years. It’s an acknowledgment that shopping in 2020 will not be the same as in years past and that its employees need a break. In addition, it’s stumping up an additional $428 million in bonuses — the third time this year the company has paid workers an extra amount, taking the total to $1.1 billion.  Still, Walmart has benefited from Covid-19 as people stock up on milk, toilet paper and other goods like gardening tools. Year-to-date, Walmart’s shares have returned 12% as a result of a combination of share price increase, buybacks and dividends, according to Refinitiv data. That’s some 40 times more than employees are getting. (By Jennifer Saba)  CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. Not all airlines are created equal. Four of them – United Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways’ parent International Consolidated Airlines, and Deutsche Lufthansa – have asked U.S. and EU leaders to introduce a coronavirus testing program that would help a rebound in international travel, according to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday. The same day, United warned that demand for flights would languish until there was a widespread vaccine, a similar caution to Delta Air Lines’s warnings last week.  United already mortgaged its airlines miles program to secure a government loan. Others, like Spirit Airlines and American, which will report earnings on Thursday, have seen shares decline by about two-thirds over the past 12 months, even as the S&P 500 Index has risen. And yet one carrier stands out. Shares in Southwest Airlines, which carries relatively little debt, have declined by about half as much as close peers. If the pandemic becomes a game of winners and losers, Southwest has the lightest load. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)  FLYING HIGH. The Covid-19 vaccine bubble has been good for smaller biotech firms – the combined market value of five of them has risen more than $50 billion of late, for example. Now Pfizer is getting in on the act. The pharma giant added $9 billion to its roughly $200 billion valuation on Wednesday morning after the U.S. government placed an initial order of nearly $2 billion for 100 million doses of the vaccine it’s developing with German biotech BioNTech.  The two partners will only be paid once the drug is approved. Even then, the bump to revenue and profit is likely to be modest. Subsequent orders might be bigger and more profitable. But 150 different vaccines are under development, so competition is likely to reduce the price and number Pfizer can sell – AstraZeneca has said it will price its vaccine at cost during the pandemic. Listen out for the sound of a pop. (By Robert Cyran)  CRYSTALLIZING OPPORTUNITY. Snap on Tuesday reported a slight second-quarter miss in daily active user growth, which increased by 17% to 238 million compared to the same period last year. Shares dropped some 7% in early trading Wednesday after the disappearing-message app said the jump in users due to the coronavirus-induced lockdowns disappeared faster than expected.  Snapchat’s owner may have been hurt by the surge in popularity of viral video app TikTok, but Evan Spiegel’s firm can also take advantage of its rival’s headaches. The U.S. government sees the ByteDance-owned service as a national-security risk and wants to ban it.  Snap has already gained from the ad boycott at Facebook, which helped spur a 17% jump in Snap’s revenue. Alluding to his bigger competitor’s troubles, Spiegel said the growing focus on brand safety and privacy puts Snap in a unique position. He could say the same about TikTok. Oh snap! (By Gina Chon)  LONG WINTER. European airlines are flying into gloomier trading conditions. That was the message from the chief executives who met virtually on Wednesday, as they pressed to extend a waiver on rules governing landing slots. In normal times, carriers are required to use 80% of their slots or forfeit these highly valued assets. European regulators eased the rules during lockdown, but only until October.  Executives including Air France-KLM boss Ben Smith and Kenton Jarvis, CEO of TUI Aviation, say returning closer to normality will take longer. Airlines typically lose money in the winter anyway, but lockdown and fears of catching Covid-19 in the skies have dampened demand further. The airlines, many of which have raised capital or sought government support, have talked of an eventual recovery in passenger numbers. Smith has reassured investors he is ramping up flight frequencies. First, however, carriers need to get through a harsh winter. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HOME IMPROVEMENT. The end of lockdown has done little to dampen the DIY boom. Consumers who were confined at home tackled home repairs and gardening jobs with such enthusiasm that Kingfisher, the 5 billion pound operator of B&Q in the United Kingdom and Castorama in France, on Wednesday released an unscheduled trading update. Sales soared 25% in June from a year earlier, having increased 15% in May. Online sales, however, were the clear winner as demand for items that can be delivered, such as wallpaper, fences and plants, leapt 225%.  Running a DIY retailer is also getting cheaper. Although Kingfisher had to pay for protective equipment for staff, including barriers and hand sanitiser, its advertising and marketing budget fell as customers needed little encouragement to enter their stores. Kingfisher’s share price rose nearly 10% on Wednesday. The longer consumers’ desire to upgrade and refurbish persists, the happier investors will be. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HOME SICK. Hong Kong is shutting down once again. The financial hub has recorded a spike in Covid-19 cases since July 13, logging over 50 cases daily and a high of 108. Foreign students were blamed for a second wave in March, and now fingers are being pointed at flight crews, sailors and senior executives exempted from quarantine.  The local government has defended the exceptions. Financial services, trade and logistics account for a total of two-fifths of Hong Kong’s economy, and they can’t work well, or at all, unless their staff can move across borders. So authorities are hesitant to impose stricter measures, perhaps with an eye on fellow hub Singapore, which reported a 41% fall in GDP after its own lockdown. But of course a third major outbreak will cancel the benefits of selective relaxation. It is a harrowing warning for what’s ahead of the curve for the many metropolises still trying to flatten it. (By Jamie Lo)  MIND THE GAP. London’s Central Line emptied out in March, as did the coffers of the tube’s parent organisation. Transport for London, chaired by Mayor Sadiq Khan, needed a 1.6 billion pound government bailout back in May. That prompted parallel funding reviews to be launched this week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government and Khan.  There’s a clear opportunity to improve. TfL is one of the few major transport networks in Europe that receives no funding for its operations from the central government. If fares dip, and it can’t borrow to cover the gap, bailouts are likely. It would be simpler for the state to formalise a financial backstop to allow investment to be maintained and ensure trains are clean post-pandemic. Fares may be lower for some time given emptier trains and buses. The state, which has the lowest cost of funding, is the best placed to pick up the bill. (By Liam Proud)",
"U.S. home sales rack up record gain; tight supply, COVID-19 seen slowing momentum","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased by the most on record in June, boosted by historically low mortgage rates, but the outlook for the  housing market is being clouded by low inventory and high unemployment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  The report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday, which also showed house prices rising to an all-time high last month, confirmed a shift toward bigger homes and properties away from urban centers as companies allow employees flexibility to work from home because of the coronavirus.   The upbeat housing market news was overshadowed by a relentless surge in new COVID-19 infections, which has prompted some authorities in the hard hit South and West regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, threatening the economy’s recovery from the COVID-19 slump.   “While fundamentals will support some activity, the slow recovery in the economy and labor market will limit the growth in home sales,” said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “The leveling off in the recovery as new Covid-19 cases surge lends a further downside risk, particularly since hard-hit regions account for the largest shares of home sales.”  Existing home sales jumped 20.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.72 million units last month. The percentage  gain was the largest since 1968 when the NAR started tracking the series. Sales plunged to a 3.91 million unit pace in May, the lowest level since October 2010.   June’s increase ended three straight months of decreases, though home resales remained 18% below their pre-pandemic level. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rebounding 24.5% to a rate of 4.78 million units in June.  Existing home sales, which make up about 85% of U.S. home sales, fell 11.3% on a year-on-year basis in June.   The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 2.98%, the lowest since 1971, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Data last week showed homebuilding increased in June by the most in nearly four years.  A separate report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase a home increased 2% last week from a week earlier. The economy slipped into recession in February. A staggering 32 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks.  Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher amid optimism about another round of fiscal stimulus for the economy. The PHLX housing index rose, outperforming the broader stock market. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.  Home sales rose surged in all four regions last month. Demand for housing was skewed toward single-family homes, mostly in the suburbs and smaller towns, with people seeking large spaces for home offices and schooling.  Economists believe the migration to suburbs from city centers could become permanent even if a vaccine is developed for the respiratory illness. A homebuilder survey last week showed strong demand for single-family homes in lower density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro suburbs.   Single-family home sales advanced 19.9% in June. While multi-family home sales shot up 29.4%, they accounted for only 9% of sales, down from the 12% that is considered the norm for the housing market.   There were 1.57 million previously owned homes on the market in June, down 18.2% from a year ago. The median existing house price increased 3.5% from a year ago to a record $295,300 in June. The NAR attributed the modest percentage gain to sales being concentrated in the more affordable markets in the South.  At June’s sales pace, it would take 4.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.3 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.  Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 24 days, down from 26 days in May, and 27 days in June 2019. Sixty-two percent of homes sold in June were on the market for less than a month. Tight supply was causing bidding wars in competitive markets.  First-time buyers accounted for 35% of sales in June, up from 34% in May 2020 and matching the share during the same period in 2019. Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, bought 9% of homes in June, down from 14% in May.   “The resilience of home prices, particularly given the rise in mortgages delinquency rates and increased use of forbearance, has likely pulled many investors to the sidelines,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

US STOCKS-Stimulus bets buoy futures ahead of jobless claims,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window)  * Futures up: Dow 0.48%, S&P 0.46%, Nasdaq 0.92%  By Medha Singh and Devik Jain  July 23 (Reuters) - S&P 500 and Dow futures hovered near five-month highs on Thursday, as signs that a new coronavirus relief package was at hand lifted sentiment ahead of weekly unemployment data.  Leading U.S. Senate Republicans and the White House late on Wednesday said they had hammered out agreements in principle on portions of a potential coronavirus-response bill, as lawmakers raced to pass legislation by the end of July.  Optimism about a potential vaccine, fiscal stimulus and improving economic data has helped the benchmark S&P 500 recoup most of its virus-induced losses and rise 1.4% this year. The blue-chip Dow is still down about 5% year-to-date, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has climbed about 19%.  Of the 75 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results, 77.3% of them have beaten profit estimates.  Tesla Inc rose 5.3% premarket after posting a fourth consecutive quarterly profit, clearing a hurdle that could lead to the electric carmaker’s inclusion in the S&P 500 index.  Microsoft Corp slipped 1.6% as its flagship cloud computing business Azure reported quarterly sales growth of under 50% for the first time ever.  The Labor Department’s most timely data on the economy is likely to show about 1.30 million filed for jobless claims last week, unchanged from the prior week as a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases chipped at the budding recovery.  California on Wednesday overtook New York as the worst-hit state for cases as U.S. deaths from the coronavirus rose by more than 1,100 for a second day in a row.  At 6:23 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 128 points, or 0.48%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 15 points, or 0.46%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 99.25 points, or 0.92%.  Home builder PulteGroup Inc jumped about 5% after posting higher quarterly profit, as record low mortgage rates encouraged Americans to buy homes.  Southwest Airlines Co posted a $915 million quarterly loss and warned travel demand would remain depressed until a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 becomes available. Still, its shares rose 0.9%.  American Airlines Group Inc, Alaska Air Group Inc , microblogging website Twitter Inc and wireless carrier AT&T Inc are also due to report results on Thursday.

"UPDATE 2-PulteGroup sees boost to 2020 sales from low mortgage rates, flight to suburbs","(Adds details from the conference call on full-year outlook)  By Ankit Ajmera  July 23 (Reuters) - PulteGroup on Thursday forecast strong full-year sales after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit and orders as record-low mortgage rates and a shift towards suburban living amid the coronavirus crisis propped up interest in homebuying.  Shares of the U.S. homebuilder rose 9% in early trading.  The housing sector has seen a fast recovery from the initial round of lockdowns, with rock bottom interest rates helping drive sales higher.  Pulte said it saw a “remarkable rebound” in demand as orders, an indicator of future sales, jumped 50% in June, recovering sharply from a 53% plunge in April, led by strong demand among first-time home buyers.  “The recovery in demand reflects a number of factors, including low interest rates...and a desire among some buyers to exit more densely populated urban centers,” Chief Executive Officer Ryan Marshall said.  “Roughly half of our division presidents report that their business has experienced a modest increase in demand from urban buyers.”  A nationwide Harris poll has also shown that almost 40% of urban dwellers would now consider moving to less populated areas.  The recovery in demand at Pulte was led by an 8% rise in orders in Texas, the company’s second biggest market by home deliveries.  For the second-quarter, overall orders were down about 4% to 6,522 homes compared with a year earlier, but beat estimates of 5,633 homes.  Pulte, which withdrew its full-year outlook in April, said it expects to achieve full-year deliveries in a range of 23,500 and 24,000 homes, above analysts’ estimates of 23,125 deliveries, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Home sales at Pulte rose 6% to 5,937 homes in the quarter ended June 30.  On an adjusted basis, Pulte earned $1.15 per share, beating analysts’ estimate of 87 cents per share.

"Morning News Call - India, July 23",,
U.S. eviction bans are ending. That could worsen the spread of coronavirus,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last month, as the coronavirus was surging in Houston, recently unemployed hospital secretary Ramzan Boudoin got more bad news: She had six days to vacate her apartment for failing to pay the rent.  A Texas ban on evictions had enabled Boudoin to keep the two-bedroom place she shared with her daughter and granddaughter while she searched for another job. But that moratorium expired on May 18. The landlord took legal action and Boudoin couldn’t come up with $2,997 plus interest to settle the judgment.  So this month Boudoin, 46, packed her family into a 2008 Nissan compact and headed to New Orleans, where she moved in with her mother and her sister’s family. In all, nine people share the packed three-bedroom house. Bedouin said her mother suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, a lung illness that makes her particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 in a city where cases are rising at an alarming pace.  “Every minute, we are worried someone is going to give it to her,” Boudoin said.  As the coronavirus began to shut down large swaths of the U.S. economy in March, spiraling millions of Americans into unemployment, a patchwork of state and federal eviction bans were enacted to keep people in their homes. Now those protections are vanishing. Moratoriums have already expired in 29 states and are about to lapse in others. On Friday, a federal stay, which protects roughly one-third of American renters who live in buildings with mortgages backed by the federal government, will run out unless Congress acts fast.  As many as 28 million people could be evicted in coming months, according to Emily Benfer, a visiting law professor at Wake Forest University who is the co-creator of Princeton University’s Eviction Lab, a national research center on evictions. That’s nearly triple the estimated 10 million Americans who lost their homes during the years after the 2008  mortgage crisis.  Public health and housing experts say such a massive displacement of renters would be unprecedented in modern history. In addition to the hardship that comes with losing one’s home, they say, the evictions could lead to a second-wave public health crisis as the newly homeless are forced into shelters or tight quarters with relatives, increasing the risk of spread of COVID-19.  Evictions have resumed in cities including Houston, Cincinnati, Columbus, Kansas City, Cleveland and St. Louis, according to data compiled by Princeton University at its Eviction Lab. No single, comprehensive source exists to track U.S. evictions nationwide.  In Milwaukee, eviction filings dropped to nearly zero after Wisconsin instituted an emergency 60-day ban on evictions on March 27. But after that order was lifted May 26, evictions surged past their pre-pandemic levels. Milwaukee recorded 1,966 eviction filings in the seven weeks following the ban’s expiration, an 89% increase from 1,038 notices filed in the seven weeks leading up to the moratorium, the Princeton data show.  Graphic: Milwaukee evictions here  Dr. Nasia Safdar, an infectious disease physician and the medical director for infection prevention at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, said it’s impossible at this point to establish a scientific correlation between evictions and COVID-19 spread and deaths; diagnosed coronavirus cases are up 150% in Milwaukee, for example, since the eviction moratorium ended.  What is not in doubt among public health experts, she said, is that evictions are dangerous during a pandemic. “A key tenet of prevention in a pandemic is to have the infrastructure that will minimize transmission from person to person,” Safdar said. “Any activity that breaks down that structure ... makes containment of a pandemic exceedingly difficult.”  A July 17 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that in 44 U.S. cities and counties, eviction filings by landlords have almost returned to their usual levels in places where moratoriums have expired, or where bans were never enacted.   That study said evicted tenants are “at greater risk of contracting, spreading and suffering complications from COVID-19” because precariously housed people often are unable to shelter in place, and because they tend to use crowded emergency rooms for their primary medical care.  As evictions rise in some coronavirus hot spots, displaced families are doubling up with relatives or moving into shelters, creating conditions for the virus to spread widely, according to Diane Yentel, president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Low Income Housing Coalition, the U.S.’s premiere affordable housing policy group.  “In these cases where social distancing is difficult or impossible, the likelihood of them contracting and spreading coronavirus increases exponentially,” Yentel said.  A fragile safety net is adding to the strain. Enhanced $600 weekly unemployment benefits provided by the federal government are set to evaporate next week, at a time when the national unemployment rate is 13.3%.  Landlords say the pandemic is a crisis for them as well. Bob Pinnegar, CEO of the National Apartment Association, says eviction is always a “last resort,” but “the rental housing industry alone cannot bear the financial burden of the pandemic.”  He said nearly half the country’s landlords are mom-and pop operators who have invested in rental property for retirement income.  For weeks, eviction courts across America were shuttered due to COVID-19. Now, over Zoom, conference calls and even in person in some places, proceedings are ramping up again.  In Houston’s Harris County, more than 5,100 eviction cases have been filed since the virus upended the U.S. economy in March, according to data compiled by Houston-based data science firm January Advisors.  That’s still roughly half of pre-pandemic levels. But it’s worrisome to public health advocates given that Harris County has seen confirmed coronavirus cases jump 500% since Texas’s eviction ban was lifted May 18, the Reuters COVID tracker shows.  Swapnil Agarwal is the 39-year-old founder of Nitya Capital, one of the largest landlords in Texas and owner of the Providence at Champions Apartment Homes from which Boudoin was evicted. During the pandemic, the company has filed more than 120 eviction notices against renters in Houston, a Reuters review of court records found. Houston-based Nitya has $2 billion in real estate assets under management, according to its website.  Agarwal said his firm evicted Boudoin because she was behind on her rent and “we realized that there was no intention to pay,” an allegation she disputes. He said Nitya has gone to great lengths to keep tenants in place and has provided $4 million in rent assistance to those who lost their jobs.  Meanwhile in Milwaukee, Mariah Smith was served an eviction notice on July 1. A shipping clerk for an aircraft parts maker, she lost her job in May. Smith said she hasn’t been able to pay her rent because she never received her $1,200 federal stimulus check and is still waiting to receive unemployment benefits.  Her fortunes have only gotten worse. Smith, 25, last week was diagnosed with coronavirus after experiencing chills, body aches and a sore throat. She said just walking leaves her winded.  On Thursday, she faces a court hearing on her eviction. Nick Homan, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, agreed to help. He said he’s handling around 25 eviction cases a week now, more than double his typical load.  After Reuters contacted Smith’s landlord — a limited liability company named LPT 46 — an attorney representing the firm, Marvin Bynum II, said the company just learned of Smith’s COVID diagnosis. “The landlord is hopeful that Ms. Smith recovers soon, and is confident the parties can swiftly reach a mutually amicable resolution,” Bynum said.  Homan said he’ll see what happens Thursday, but the larger issue remains.  “There’s nobody in any position of authority to stop eviction right now,” Homan said. “I don’t see anybody making decisions on public health. I only see landlords making decisions about their finances.” ",Reporting by Michelle Conlin; Editing by Tom Lasseter and Marla Dickerson
